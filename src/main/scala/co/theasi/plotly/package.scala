/** ==Scala Plotly client==
  *
  * Plotly is a platform for creating and hosting plots. This
  * library lets you create, modify and delete plots on Plotly.
  *
  * Build a plot using [[Plot]], and send that
  * plot to the Plotly servers with [[draw]].
  *
  * {{{
  * import co.theasi.plotly._
  *
  * val xs = Vector(1, 2, 3)
  * val ys = Vector(4.5, 8.5, 21.0)
  *
  * val p = Plot().withScatter(xs, ys)
  * draw(p, "my-first-plot")
  * }}}
  *
  * ==Useful links==
  *
  * For more information on how to build complex plot objects,
  * read the documentation for [[Plot]].
  *
  * To control how the client deals with existing files with
  * the same name on the Plotly server, and to control the
  * privacy options, read the documentation
  * for [[writer.FileOptions]]
